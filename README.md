# Test
Created a signup.html page to register the Username and password 
when you click the sign up button ,values are store in the Database which I created Table Army with columns (Unames,passwords).
for storing the values into database I created a Manohar servlet with the database connection code.
Ater going to the Login.html when the details are matched with the values in database It will redirect to the Home.jsp file.
when you enter the values incorrect it will redirect to the Login page.
In Home.jsp file where you want to select the user to send message.the messages are stored in the database with table Message with columns 
fromuser,touser,Message.
Send message it will redirect to the Display.jsp where are all the messages are stored.
Ih has the option to get back to the send message option.
Ignore the UI.
